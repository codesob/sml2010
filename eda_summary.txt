Summary of EDA, Visualization, Modeling Algorithms, and Evaluation Metrics in the folder:

1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Visualization:
- Missing value checks and data type conversions.
- Descriptive statistics and summary statistics.
- Histograms and distribution plots of features.
- Boxplots and normalized boxplots for outlier detection.
- Pairplots to visualize feature relationships.
- Time series plots (temperature over time).
- Categorical data analysis (day of week frequency).
- Group-by analysis (average temperature by day and season).
- Anomaly detection using z-score.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Residual analysis and Q-Q plots.
- Feature importance and partial dependence plots.
- 3D scatter plots.
- Various line plots and bar charts for environmental and sensor data analysis.

2. Modeling Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- ARIMA (time series forecasting)

3. Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared Score (R2)
- Cross-validation RMSE scores
- Statistical summaries from ARIMA model
- Visual comparison plots of actual vs predicted values and error distributions

In total, the folder contains multiple EDA and visualization techniques (more than 15 types), 5 modeling algorithms, and at least 6 evaluation metrics.

This comprehensive set covers the typical workflow of data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

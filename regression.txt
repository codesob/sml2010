Linear Regression:
Simple Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable.
Multiple Linear Regression: Uses multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable. 
Regularized Regression:
Ridge Regression:
Adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function to prevent overfitting by shrinking coefficients, particularly useful when multicollinearity is present. 
Lasso Regression:
Adds an L1 penalty, which can lead to feature selection by forcing some coefficients to zero. 
Elastic Net Regression:
Combines the penalties from Ridge and Lasso regressions, offering a balance between shrinking and feature selection. 
Non-Linear Regression:
Polynomial Regression:
Models non-linear relationships by adding polynomial terms to the independent variables. 
Decision Tree Regression:
Uses a tree-like structure to make predictions, where each branch represents a decision based on feature values. 
Random Forest Regression:
An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, improving accuracy and robustness. 
Support Vector Regression (SVR):
A regression technique based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). 
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Regression:
Predicts values based on the similarity to the nearest neighbors in the training data. 
Neural Network Regression:
Uses artificial neural networks to model complex relationships, often suitable for non-linear data. 
Quantile Regression:
Models the conditional quantiles of the dependent variable, allowing for more nuanced predictions. 
Quantile Regression:
Models the conditional quantiles of the dependent variable, allowing for more nuanced predictions. 
Quantile Regression:
Models the conditional quantiles of the dependent variable, allowing for more nuanced predictions. 
Other Regression Models:
Quantile Regression:
Models the conditional quantiles of the dependent variable, allowing for more nuanced predictions. 
Poisson Regression:
Used for modeling count data, where the dependent variable represents the number of occurrences of an event. 
Negative Binomial Regression:
Similar to Poisson regression but allows for overdispersion in the count data. 
Cox Regression:
Used for survival analysis, predicting the probability of an event occurring within a certain time. 
Bayesian Linear Regression:
A probabilistic approach to linear regression, incorporating prior knowledge about the parameters.
